#
# A string table consists of a list of string keys and their associated text
# values. They are used to create a language-independent way to refer to
# strings so that the content of those strings can be translated.
# The file for the default translation (this file) contains the "fallback" text
# to use when a translation for the user's language is not available. The
# fallback file is normally English. (Of the languages commonly found in a
# Strange Eons plug-in, English is the language that a user is most likely to
# be able to read if their preferred language is not available.) To translate
# the strings in this table, right click on the file in project pane and
# choose the "Add Locale" command. It is a good idea to add files
# for the language used in the default translation (even though it will be
# empty since there are no strings to replace). This shows at a glance what
# languages are available, and makes it easier to add variants should someone
# wish to do so (such as adding support for Australian English to a plug-in
# that already supports US English.)
#
# Each string appears on its own line and is separated by an equals sign (=).
# Like a settings file, long lines can be split into multiple lines
# by ending each line but the last with a backslash (\). The backslash can
# also be used to escape special characters; for example, a key name can include
# an equals sign if it is escaped (\=). If the first non-blank character in a
# line is a number sign (#), then the entire line is treated as a comment and
# will be ignored.
#

#
# X-wing Interface Strings
#
# This file contains the localized text that can appear in
# the user interface, such as interface control labels. You
# can access interface strings using the '@' special variable
# name prefix. Like setting names, any dashes should be
# replaced with underscores when using this notation.
